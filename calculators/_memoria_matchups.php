        - games under 30 seconds don\'t count, games under 4 minutes have lowered rating change (x0.5 >> x1)
        - players start at 2500 rating, 4000 rating difference â‰ˆ 90% win prediction, prediction gets more exagerated the more onesided the matchup is
        - max 250 rating per match, decreases if teammate rating difference for either of the teams is more than 2500
        - win prediction is calculated for each matchup (each 1v1), then it\'s combined into a final prediction
        - in case of an uneven game (NvM), each possible matchup is calculated, and rating change is adjusted to the player count ratio
        - if someone crashes before the game starts, that player loses some rating, but is not considered for matchup calculations (as if the player was not in the game)
        - afterwards, if there are leavers, respective team\'s rating gain from winning will be lower; if two people from opposite teams leave within 10 seconds, or if the first leave is within 1 minute of the game ending, rating gain stays the same
